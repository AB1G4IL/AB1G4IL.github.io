<h1>How To Have a Succesful Preppy Account</h1>
<p>If you want to make good content, you just need to follow a few simple steps. <br>
 It helps if you have a newer phone model, but anything works (besides an iPad!!) </p>

<h3>Heres the list!!</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Make sure you have good lighting! Try to film when in a sun <br>
		(if not, use a ring light!! If a ring light is not accesible, <br>
		 settle for the flashlight on your phone.)</li>
		 <br>
	<li>Hold your phone still and make sure it isn't glitchy/shaky! <br>
	 Don't film when your phone is at a low battery percentage <br>
	(it makes your clips lower quality and glitchy)</li>
	<br>
	<li>Film short, quick clips. Make sure you aren't showing anything unpreppy! </li>
	<br>
	<li>Use preppy, trendy audios (make sure they have loads of views!!)</li>
	<br>
	<li>Here is a preppy tip from the preppiest of the preppy Cate Woeber: "Buy the Drunk <br>
	Elephant lotion to look good. But PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not use it. No <br>
	hate or anything I know some people really resonate with the smell and <br>
    texture of glue. <br>
	 </li>
</ul>
