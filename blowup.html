<p>If you want to get on the fyp, you just need to follow a few simple steps.  </p>

<h3>Heres the list!!</h3>

<ul>
	<li>A big part of going viral is having good content! <br>
		Use the page "How to Have Good Conetent" as a  <br>
		reference! :)) </li> <br>
		
		<li>Always use popular hashtags that are revelant to your post! For <br>
	 example, use #fyp or #preppy. But DONT use too many hashtags!! <br> </li>
	<br>
	<li>As tempting as it seems, DO NOT self promote your account on others <br>
	posts!! It's annoying, and people will block you! Also, it won't do much for <br>
	your accoutnt.  </li>
	<br>
	<li>Make sure that the audios you use have loads of views. Never use your own <br>
	audio, and try your best to use a sound that a lot of people have used recently! </li>
	
</ul>
